rules:
  model:
    - code: SIM001
      name: unused-functions
      category: spec
      severity: info
      fixable: true
      message: Model contains functions that are not referenced by any node.
      suggestion: Remove unused functions with `--fix` or `RemoveUnusedFunctionsPass`.
      explanation: |
        Functions defined in the model that are not called by any node in the
        graph or other functions are dead code. Removing them reduces model
        size and improves clarity.

    - code: SIM002
      name: unused-opset-imports
      category: spec
      severity: info
      fixable: true
      message: Model imports opsets that are not used by any node.
      suggestion: Remove unused opset imports with `--fix` or `RemoveUnusedOpsetsPass`.
      explanation: |
        Opset imports that are not referenced by any node in the graph are
        unnecessary. Removing them simplifies the model metadata.

  node:
    - code: SIM003
      name: unused-node
      category: spec
      severity: info
      fixable: true
      message: Node outputs are not consumed.
      suggestion: Remove unused nodes with `--fix` or `RemoveUnusedNodesPass`.
      explanation: |
        Nodes whose outputs are not consumed by any subsequent node or graph
        output are dead code. Removing them reduces model size and may
        improve inference performance.
